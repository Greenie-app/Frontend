# Greenie.app

Greenie.app is an online "Greenie Board" for carrier-based virtual squadrons,
especially squadrons that operate in Digital Combat Simulator: World. Squadrons
can add passes manually or by uploading dcs.log files, and track the performance
of their pilots.

Greenie.app consists of an API back-end, written in Ruby on Rails (this
repository) and a tightly-coupled front-end, written in TypeScript and Vue.js.
Along with these two processes, the website also uses a Sidekiq process to
execute background tasks, and a separate instance of the Rails server to send
and receive data via WebSockets (Action Cable).

For more general information, see the
[backend repository](https://github.com/Greenie-app/Backend). This README covers
the frontend repository only.

## Development

### Installation and Running

Greenie.app requires a modern version of Node.js and Yarn. Run `yarn install` to
install all NPM dependencies.

Run the local development server by running `yarn serve`, and build the
production assets by running `yarn build`. See the backend repository to learn
how to boot the entire stack and test the whole website.

### Documentation

Comprehensive documentation can be generated by running `yarn docs:generate`.
HTML documentation is generated into the `doc/` directory.

### Testing

Unit tests are written in Mocha using Chai, and can be run with
`yarn test:unit`. Unit tests are not comprehensive; they are only written for
methods and classes with notably complex logic.

End-to-end testing is powered by Cypress. Run `yarn test:e2e` to launch the
Cypress test framework. The backend and many other processes will have to also
be running for end-to-end tests to work. See the Backend repository for more
information. End-to-end tests do not function in isolation; each test depends
on the successful completion of every test before it. They should only be run
as an entire suite, in order.

### Deployment

This application is deployed using Fly.io. The `deploy.yml` GitHub Actions
workflow runs automatically after CI completes.

## Architecture

The frontend website is built using TypeScript and Vue.js. The root view is
{Layout}, which uses Vue-Router to render the appropriate subviews. Shared
functionality is kept under `components/` and individual views under `views/`.
Components include {MustBeAuthenticated} and {MustBeUnauthenticated}, which act
as guards; {Error} and {Spinner} which are full-page views for global error and
loading states; {FieldWithErrors} and {Datetime} which are used to render forms;
and other utility views.

String assets are managed by Vue-I18n and localized (to English only, 
currently).

State information is managed by Vuex. The main Vuex store is split into a number
of different modules. The `squadron` module manages state for the squadron whose
greenie board the logged-in user is viewing; the `mySquadron` module manages 
state for the squadron the logged-in user is logged in as (if any). The other 
modules are more or less self-explanatory. The `coding.ts` file contains bridges 
between the JSON representation of these modules sent by the backend, and the 
TypeScript classes used by the frontend.
